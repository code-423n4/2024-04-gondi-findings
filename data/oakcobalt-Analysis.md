## Summary
Gondi is a decentralized NFT lending protocol offering flexibility and efficiency. Borrowers access liquidity at the best rates, while lenders earn yield with the freedom to enter and exit positions without impacting loans. Gondi V3 loans draw from protocol pools and peer markets, ensuring deep liquidity and accurate risk pricing.

**Existing Standards:**
- ERC721
- ERC20
- EIP712

## 1- Approach:
- Scope: Focused on main loan management flows and loan contract-related flows. 
- Roles: Role-specific flows include borrower, lender, liquidator, and owner flows.
- State accounting: fee-related accounting (protocol fees, originator fees, etc), loan storage accounting (outstanding values + withdrawal queue-related values)
- Common attack vectors: reentrancy, MEV, etc.

## 2- Centralization Risks:
Here's an analysis of potential centralization risks in the provided contracts:

### MultiSourceLoan.sol
- onlyOwner flows: Owner can re-set certain registry contracts ( getDelegateRegistry , getFlashActionContract). 
- overall low centralization risks.

### Pool.sol
- onlyOwner flows: Owner can re-set certain registry contracts 
- pause feature. Pause will disable deposit and validateOffer.

Note: Other contracts related to loan management have relatively low centralization risks with mainly fee-related owner configurable settings.

## 3- Systemic Risks:
### Third-party integration risks:
Both src/lib/pools/AaveUsdcBaseInterestAllocator.sol and src/lib/pools/LidoEthBaseInterestAllocator.sol rely on external protocol or exchange market for yield generation. This poses unique third-party risks which might impact liquid assets available in Pool.sol

## 4- Mechanism Review:
### LoanManager.sol cannot remove accepted callers
LoanManager contract can only add callers (liquidators or loan contract), but cannot remove callers. If any accepted caller is compromised, this might pose risks in the pool contract.



## Conclusions:

In conclusion, Gondi presents a promising solution in the realm of decentralized NFT lending, offering a blend of flexibility and efficiency for both borrowers and lenders. Through its innovative approach and utilization of existing standards such as ERC721, ERC20, and EIP712, Gondi addresses key aspects of loan management flows and contract-related processes. While centralization risks are minimal across most contracts analyzed, attention must be paid to potential vulnerabilities such as those identified in MultiSourceLoan.sol and Pool.sol. Additionally, systemic risks stemming from third-party integrations highlight the importance of monitoring external dependencies. Mechanism reviews, such as the inability to remove accepted callers in LoanManager.sol, underscore the necessity for ongoing evaluation and refinement to ensure the robustness and security of the Gondi protocol.
